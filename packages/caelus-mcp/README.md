# caelus-mcp

MCP server for the [caelus](https://github.com/heavyblotto/caelus) ephemeris
engine: seven chart tools over stdio. Computation only — positions, houses,
aspects with orbs, event search — the model does the interpreting. No API
keys, no ephemeris files, no network calls; the engine data ships inside the
package.

## Setup

Any MCP client that speaks stdio:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "caelus": { "command": "npx", "args": ["caelus-mcp"] }
  }
}
```

- **Claude Desktop** — `claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Cursor** — `.cursor/mcp.json` (project) or `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (global)
- **Anything else** — spawn `npx caelus-mcp` and speak JSON-RPC over stdio

## Tools

| tool | what it answers |
|------|-----------------|
| `natal_chart` | A person's birth chart: 13 bodies with sign, house, retrograde, speed; ASC/MC; cusps; aspects |
| `current_sky` | The sky at a moment and place (defaults to now), not tied to a person |
| `transits` | Transiting planets vs a natal chart: aspects within orb, applying/separating, natal house per body |
| `synastry` | Two charts compared: inter-chart aspects, house overlays both ways |
| `find_aspect_dates` | Exact dates a transiting body aspects a longitude or another body, retrograde re-hits included |
| `rectification_grid` | ASC/MC sweep across a window of hours for birth-time rectification |
| `sky_events` | Rise/set/meridian transits, lunar phases, stations, zodiac crossings in a date range (≤370 days) |

Bodies (core chart): sun through pluto, chiron, mean and true node. Optional
bodies (mean/true Lilith, asteroids, Uranians) follow engine data on the Node
loader path. House systems: twelve total — placidus (default), whole_sign,
equal, porphyry, koch, regiomontanus, campanus, alcabitius, morinus,
meridian, polich_page, vehlow. Placidus and Koch fall back to whole_sign
above the polar circles and say so in the payload. `zodiac` supports tropical
(default) and five sidereal ayanamsas on chart tools.

## Output

Token-frugal JSON: terse keys, positions to 0.01°, a full natal chart is
~2.5 KB. Each aspect is a structured object the client can use directly:

```json
{ "a": "moon", "b": "venus", "aspect": "trine", "orb": 2.09 }
```

A `natal_chart` or `current_sky` response feeds
[caelus-wheel](https://www.npmjs.com/package/caelus-wheel)'s `<ChartWheel>`
directly — no adapter:

```tsx
const payload = JSON.parse(result.content[0].text);
<ChartWheel chart={payload} size={520} />
```

## Dates are UT

Tools take ISO 8601 UTC date-times. Convert local birth times first — the
tool descriptions instruct the model to do this, and
[caelus-birth](https://www.npmjs.com/package/caelus-birth) does it correctly
in code (historical tzdb rules, DST edge cases flagged). Longitude is
east-positive everywhere; the Americas are negative.

## Accuracy

Checked against Swiss Ephemeris across 1900–2099: Sun–Saturn ≤1″,
Uranus ≤1.9″, Neptune ≤4.6″, Moon ≤2.5″, Pluto ≤2.5″ (series valid
1885–2099), Chiron ≤1″, mean node ≤1″, true node ≤1′ vs SE's built-in
ephemeris, asteroids ≤1″ (Horizons fits), Uranians ≤2.3″. Tables:

## The caelus packages

- [caelus](https://www.npmjs.com/package/caelus) — the engine
- [caelus-birth](https://www.npmjs.com/package/caelus-birth) — local birth time + place → UT
- [caelus-wheel](https://www.npmjs.com/package/caelus-wheel) — React SVG chart wheel
- caelus-mcp — this package
